<p class=MsoNormal>October 18, 2004 </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Scott Rank is a senior in journalism and mass communication
from <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Knoxville</st1:place></st1:City>.
He is the opinion editor of the Daily. <br>
<br>
Hold on to your copies of &quot;On the Origin of Species,&quot; <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Iowa</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">State</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>.
<span class=GramE>Whether you know it or not, the battle for the future of how
to teach evolution in public schools is happening right here at our university.</span><br>
<br>
This battle is also happening all across the nation, and it's embodied in a new
scientific theory that is gaining steam among scientists and laymen. <br>
<br>
It's called intelligent design (ID), the argument that life shows signs of
having been designed by an intelligent agent. <br>
<br>
To critics, this &quot;intelligent agent&quot; sounds suspiciously like the Christian
Triune God, but ID is a secular theory, and there are many ID researchers who
are Jewish, Eastern Orthodox and Agnostic. The goal of the ID movement is not
to kick evolution out of schools, but to allow students to question certain
parts of Darwinian materialism.<br>
<br>
But mainstream scientists don't acknowledge ID as science. Prominent
researchers are scrambling to write articles against it, universities are
firing staff members who publicly advocate it and Wired Magazine even devoted a
cover article to it, affectionately titled &quot;The Crusade <span class=GramE>Against</span>
Evolution.&quot;<br>
<br>
This battle isn't just national -- it's also taking place right here at <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Iowa</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">State</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>.
Some of the most cutting-edge research in this controversial field is coming
from Guillermo Gonzalez, an ISU physics professor who wrote a groundbreaking
book called &quot;The Privileged Planet.&quot;<br>
<br>
The book premises that the same unlikely circumstances that allow life to exist
on earth are also the best circumstances for scientific discovery. Gonzalez
states that with all these fantastic circumstances running around, it must have
been in the cards for Earth to be in the place in the universe that it is. <br>
<br>
However, Darwinists won't have it. They paint this type of ID research as
&quot;creationism in a lab coat,&quot; an attempt to smuggle the Genesis
account of creation into a 10th-grade biology class. They think that ID should
be thrown in to history's dustbin, along with alchemy and bloodletting. <br>
<br>
Some ISU professors have jumped on the bandwagon to bash ID. Last week, two ISU
professors -- Hector Avalos and John Patterson -- presented a forum on the
flaws in ID and specifically attacked &quot;The Privileged Planet.&quot; <br>
<br>
<st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Avalos</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">Iowa</st1:State></st1:place>
State's most beloved atheist, argued against ID science from a philosophical
point of view, which was odd, since Avalos is neither a scientist nor a
philosopher. But most ISU students know that Avalos will throw mud at theism
whenever possible (if the ISU dietetics program hosted a Christian cooking
conference, Avalos would show up with a batch of homemade atheist cookies).<br>
<br>
Patterson, a retired ISU professor who gained national recognition as an
outspoken critic of creation science, said that &quot;scientific&quot;
explanations, like ID, are worse than no explanations at all because they are
absurdly wrong. <br>
<br>
There are a few things Patterson doesn't understand. First of all, modern
science wouldn't exist without a belief in a designer. The entire bedrock of
Western science is founded on being open-minded to natural things that
transcend nature, an idea that started with Aristotle. <br>
<br>
Second, Patterson, along with all other neo-Darwinists, is a victim to several
bad presuppositions. <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Darwin</st1:place></st1:City>
didn't derive his theory from nature, but superimposed his naturalistic
worldview on nature and spent his life trying to attach scientific facts to his
philosophy to make it <span class=SpellE>meritable</span>. <br>
<br>
Today, some of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Darwin</st1:place></st1:City>'s
ideas look as <span class=SpellE>cartoonish</span> as &quot;The Far Side.&quot;
He believed that <span class=GramE>undirected processes, principally natural
selection, is</span> enough to create biological complexity.<br>
<br>
But <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Darwin</st1:place></st1:City>'s
own research contradicted this. In &quot;On the Origin of the Species,&quot; <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Darwin</st1:place></st1:City> said, &quot;Can we
believe that natural selection could produce ... an organ <span class=GramE>so</span>
wonderful as the eye? How could organisms that need it survive without it while
it was evolving over thousands of millions of years?&quot;<br>
<br>
If this type of inconsistency is taught as gospel in the classroom, then I'm
baffled why most scientists are so threatened by having minor criticisms of <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Darwin</st1:place></st1:City> taught as well.
But it doesn't really matter what mainstream science thinks. ID is slowly
gaining acceptance, and it's not going away anytime soon.</p>
