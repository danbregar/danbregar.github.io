<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Evolution in the sense of common ancestry might be
true, but evolution in the neo-Darwinian sense -- an unguided, unplanned
process of random variation and natural selection -- is not. Any system of
thought that denies or seeks to explain away the overwhelming evidence for
design in biology is ideology, not science&quot; ... Christopher <st1:place

 York Times</a>, 2005 </st1:place></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Belief in the supernatural, especially belief in God,
is not only incompatible with good science, Dr. Hauptman declared, 'this kind
of belief is damaging to the well-being of the human race.'&quot; ... <a
href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/23/national/23believers.html?ex=1125979200&amp;en=3f9ed5a6e4ef10cc&amp;ei=5070">New
York Times, 2005</a> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Those who ask from science a final argument, an
ultimate proof, an unassailable position from which the issue of God may be
decided will always be disappointed. As a scientist I claim no new proofs, no
revolutionary data, <span class=GramE>no</span> stunning insight into nature
that can tip the balance in one direction or another. But I do claim that to a
believer, even in the most traditional sense, evolutionary biology is not at
all the obstacle we often believe it to be. In many respects, evolution is the
key to understanding our relationship with God&quot; ... Kenneth Miller, <a
href="http://www.brown.edu/Administration/Brown_Alumni_Magazine/00/11-99/features/darwin.html">Finding
Darwin's God: A Scientist's Search for Common Ground Between God and Evolution</a>,
in press. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Evolution is only a theory. So is God - only a theory.
There is no certainty ... There are only guesses to guide us. But that is the
way it is. Our faith is not that God has beamed us up to a higher plane of
knowing. There is no higher plane of knowing. Our faith is a fragile hope that
God lives with us in the reality of our darkness, in our search for truth, in
the bold guesses we try to live by. It's all only a theory. The question is
whether it leads anywhere.<span class=GramE>&quot; ...</span> <span

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span class=GramE>&quot; ...</span> scientific statements
are not either claims or approximations to &quot;Truth,&quot; but provisional
stories, reflecting human perspectives, that get progressively less wrong.
Whatever practical usefulness the stories have derives from and needs always to
be understood in light of their provisional character ... Scientific stories
are written not to be believed but to be understood, made use of as
appropriate, and revised ... The resulting <span class=SpellE>assailability</span>,
conflicts, and resolutions, concerning both observations and stories told about
them, are as much a part of the successes of science as any other feature of
the scientific method.<span class=GramE>&quot; ...</span> Paul <span

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;All people should be encouraged to think of their
ideas/perspectives as &quot;in progress&quot;: to make them available as
potential contributions to the thinking of <span class=GramE>others,</span> and
to make use of the thoughts of others as of potential significance to their own
thinking&quot; ... <a
href="http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/webology/principles.html"><span
class=SpellE>Serendip</span></a>, 2001</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Is it too late to prevent drawing lines in the sand on this
one? I hope not. <span class=GramE>You too, maybe?</span> How about if we all
(or at least many of us) avoid name-calling and demonizing and rabble-rousing
and instead share some of our own personal thoughts about science and religion
and evolution? <span class=GramE>With a belief in each others' integrity and in
the potential to learn from and with each other?</span> Let's try. I'll start
... and trust that others will join in. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I've always been curious about the world, about myself and
other people and the things we find around ourselves. I still am. About little
things, like what makes the sun shine, and big things, like how it all fits
together and what it all means. And I expect I always will be curious, because
one of the things I've discovered over the years is that there are indeed some
useful answers to little questions, but every time someone comes up with one
that answer itself creates new questions. And while there are lots of different
answers to the big questions, they all have problems with them and none of them
are convincing to everyone. Maybe you've noticed that too? Maybe you too have
the sense that being curious is more useful and fun if one thinks of it as a
process, a way of life, instead of as a task to be completed? And so doesn't
get too committed to particular answers to big questions? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Anyhow, that's how I think about science. And about what I
do as a scientist. What interests me is not finding &quot;Truth&quot;, the
final answers to big questions. In fact, I'm not at all sure there ARE final
answers to big questions and I am, in any case, quite sure neither I nor anyone
else yet knows how to find them if there are. What I enjoy, what motivates me,
is wondering about things and the stories I hear about them, and seeing new
things because I wondered, and making up new stories that take into account the
new things I've seen. <span class=GramE>Which in turn always (so far) creates
new things to wonder about, new observations to be made, and new stories to be
tried out.</span> <span class=SpellE>THAT's</span> useful ... and fun. And
that's science, at least as I understand it (see <a
href="http://jrp.icaap.org/content/v1.1/grobstein.html">Science as Story
Telling and Story Revising</a> and <a
href="http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/sci_cult/pragmatism.html">Getting It Less
Wrong, the Brain's Way</a>). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Given <span class=GramE>who</span> I am, how I grew up, and
the experiences I've had, I know more about science than I do about religion.
It strikes me though that at least some people involved with religion (maybe
more than a few?) see what they're doing as being pretty much the same thing as
what I'm doing, trying to make the best sense one can at any given time of a
world not fully understood (&quot;There is no certainty ... There are only
guesses to guide us&quot;). They may use different words and stories to say
what they have understood at any given time, but that's a good thing, not a bad
one if one has come to feel, as I do, that one can learn not only by having new
experiences but also by hearing new stories. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The important point, in the present context, is that I see
no need to set science and religion against one another in the case of
evolution (or any other). There may be some people involved with religion who
see science as opposed to religion, and some people involved with science who
see religion as opposed to science, but that's no reason for the rest of us to
draw lines in the sand that we neither want nor need, and that would prevent us
from contributing in our distinctive ways to each other's getting on with the
business of making sense of the world. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Maybe that's too easy? What is it about evolution in
particular that sets off red flags? And what about people who DO see science
and religion as oppositional? Let's talk a little bit about that and them, and
maybe we can together find a better way to think about these things. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Some people, within both the scientific and the religious
communities ARE interested in &quot;Truth&quot;. And that, I suspect, is <span
class=SpellE>is</span> part of the problem. For some people, there can't be
more than one &quot;Truth&quot; about something nor more than one right way to
pursue &quot;Truth&quot;, and so people with one set of understandings or
methods feel threatened by people with another set. They assert their own
version and attack any other to defend their own. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Fights about &quot;Truth&quot; have been going on for
thousands of years, and we're probably not going to entirely fix that problem
in the immediate future. We can, though, agree that since science is about
ongoing exploration and not about &quot;Truth&quot;, it doesn't belong in such
confrontations. Evolution is not &quot;Truth&quot; and can't be. Like any
scientific story, it is no more and no less than a way to make sense of
observations, and is significant only insofar as it does that well and, in so
doing, motivates new observations that would in turn lead on to new stories and
further new observations. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In these terms, evolution is not only a good scientific <span
class=GramE>story,</span> it is a VERY good one. It accounts for an
extraordinary number of observations that are difficult to account for in other
ways, and raises a large number of approachable new questions. Moreover, it is
a demonstrably useful story in a wide range of contexts. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As Cardinal <span class=SpellE>Schöborn</span> noticed,
evolution is not only about &quot;common descent&quot; but also, and perhaps
even more importantly, about &quot;an unguided, unplanned process of random
variation and natural selection&quot;. &quot;Common descent&quot; bothered
people for a while but proved useful enough (in the development of medical
therapies, among other things) to become over the years a comfortable part of
most peoples' own stories. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&quot;Random variation and natural selection&quot; is the
idea that seems to be most bothering some people now. But that too makes sense
of a lot of observations, raises lots of new interesting questions, and is
demonstrably useful. Without that idea, it would be very difficult to make
sense, for example, of the development of antibiotic resistance, and of many
other features of epidemic disease. There is a reason why <span class=GramE>its</span>
important not to overuse antibiotics. Antibiotic resistant bacteria are
produced randomly during reproduction. They are selected for and become more
prevalent when antibiotics are improperly used. Random variation and natural
selection is also an idea that underlies a lot of the programming in many
contemporary computer applications. So perhaps we can trust that this idea too
is useful enough that it will become over time a comfortable part of most
peoples' stories? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In fairness, though, it's probably not the idea itself but <span
class=GramE>it's</span> potential breadth of application that is most
troublesome to some people. Could it be that EVERYTHING we wonder about,
ourselves and everything we find around ourselves, derives, at least initially,
from nothing more (and nothing less) than &quot;an unguided, unplanned process
of random variation and natural selection&quot;? Now THAT is an interesting
question, exactly the sort of new question that good scientific stories are
supposed to create. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The question is troublesome for some people and exciting for
others, for all sorts of reasons. The important point though is that it is just
that: a good question. If SOME things (like antibiotic resistance) can usefully
be made sense of by &quot;random variation and natural selection&quot;, is it
possible that other things can also? Let's gather some more observations and
see ... That's science. <span class=GramE>Being curious.</span> <span
class=GramE>Exploring.</span> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The story of evolution is not something that &quot;denies or
seeks to explain away&quot; anything ... and is certainly not
&quot;ideology&quot;. It is a scientific story, one that usefully summarizes a
very large number of observations and creates questions that motivate new
observations. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>It is <span class=GramE>not &quot;Truth&quot; nor</span> a
candidate/competitor for the status of &quot;Truth&quot;. It is a product of
curiosity, and a stimulus for ongoing curiosity, about small questions and big
ones. It is not an answer to any big questions but rather a continuation of the
process of asking them and exploring possible answers. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>There IS no final answer to the question of whether what
gave rise to ourselves and what we find around us is &quot;random variation and
natural selection&quot;. Maybe there was and/or is a &quot;designer&quot;. Or
maybe intention, meaning, and purpose didn't exist until organisms that
themselves resulted from random variation and natural selection, <span
class=GramE>ourselves</span> included, were able to add them. And there never
will be a final answer to that question, at least from a scientific
perspective, since science is not about &quot;Truth&quot; but rather about
making sense of observations made up to the present. Its stories are always
subject to change based on future observations. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>If evolution isn't a final answer to a big question, then
there isn't much point in drawing lines in the sand about it, for us or anyone
else. And if it's a good scientific story, it should of course be made
available to others, by teaching it in science classes and writing and talking
about it. Some people might find it useful, in one way or another, and they
might say things that would in turn help the further evolution of the story. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Should people hear other proposed answers to big questions? <span
class=GramE>Of course.</span> In fact, I can't imagine teaching evolution in my
own classroom without mentioning &quot;intelligent design&quot; or some version
of it. &quot;Intelligent design&quot; is an idea that's been around for
thousands of years; <span class=GramE>its</span> the way that people usually
try and make sense of what's around them. A large part of the excitement of the
idea of &quot;random variation and natural selection&quot; is that it provides
a different way of thinking about things, and there is no way to convey that
other than by setting it in the context of other ways of thinking. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Should people hear about things that the current story of
evolution has trouble explaining? <span class=GramE>Of course.</span> That,
after all, is the point of a scientific story ... to raise new questions. That
there are questions doesn't make it a bad scientific story; it is part of what
makes it a good one. And there are lots of questions about the story of
evolution, small ones and big ones. That too is part of what makes it useful.
The story encourages further thinking and exploring. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And that's what science is really about, no? Helping people
make sense of the world by encouraging and supporting the development of their
own skills at doing so? Maybe &quot;evolution is the key to understanding our
relationship with God&quot; and maybe it's not; maybe it's something else
entirely. No one knows. But it's certainly not something to fight about. Maybe
ideology should be left to the ideologists (&quot;scientific&quot;, &quot;religious&quot;,
and otherwise; <span class=SpellE>cf</span> <a
href="http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/sci_cult/belief.html">&quot;I Believe ...<span
class=GramE>&quot;:</span> Its Significance and Limitations</a>), and the rest
of us should get on with the business of exploring and sharing useful stories
about those explorations. In <a
href="http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/local/suminst/eei03/forum7.html#6178">educational
contexts</a> and <span class=GramE>elsewhere ...</span> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>That's what I think. Evolution is a story. So too is
intelligent design. <span class=SpellE>Whats</span> worth paying attention to
is what observations the stories help to make sense of, what things they are
useful (and not useful) for, what new questions they raise. <span class=GramE>You?</span>
<a href="http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/forum/viewforum.php?forum_id=360">What do
you think? Join in</a>, and let's see whether we can together keep people from
unnecessarily drawing lines in the sand. </p>
