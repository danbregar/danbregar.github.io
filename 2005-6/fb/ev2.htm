<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>John M. Frame</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>“Intelligent Design” (henceforth ID) is the view that the
universe gives evidence of being the product of an intelligent designer. As
such it is a very old view. Certainly this was the position of the biblical
writers (as Ps. 19:1, Rom. 1:18-20). Historically, many have articulated this
position by means of the “teleological argument:” that when unintelligent
beings act for a purpose, they must be under the control of a personal
intelligence.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For the past 150 years or so, the focus has been on
teleology as opposed to atheistic evolution. Many like B. B. Warfield accepted
evolution in its general outlines, but they insisted that the evolutionary
process must have been directed by a personal God. Others, such as the
Institute for Creation Research, argued that evolution, as usually conceived,
has not occurred at all. In their view, the earth is only around 10,000 years
old, and the fossil record can be explained by Noah’s flood. Although the ICR
has been accused of imposing on nature a view derived from the Bible, they have
protested that no, their arguments are based on science alone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Today, however, “ID” refers to a specific movement that
became famous with the 1991 publication of Phillip Johnson’s <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Darwin on Trial</i>.<a style='mso-footnote-id:
ftn1' href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""> [1] Johnson is a Christian and a
professor of law at the </a><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">University</st1:PlaceType>
of <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">California</st1:PlaceName>, <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City
 w:st="on">Berkeley</st1:City></st1:place>. Other prominent members of the
movement are Michael <span class=SpellE>Behe</span><a style='mso-footnote-id:
ftn2' href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""> [2] and William </a><span
class=SpellE>Dembski</span>.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn3' href="#_ftn3"
name="_ftnref3" title=""> [3] </a><span class=SpellE>Behe</span> and <span
class=SpellE>Dembski</span> are scientists. Johnson is not, but as a lawyer he
has considerable skill at criticizing arguments, and he has used that skill
impressively in debunking Darwinist claims.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Unlike the ICR, the ID group does not argue for a young
earth or for flood geology. They are willing to accept the chronological
sequence of life-forms more or less as the evolutionists present it. But
evolutionism today (“neo-Darwinism,” as it is sometimes called) argues that
natural forces (mainly natural selection and genetic mutation) are sufficient
to account for all living beings; it is not necessary to invoke God. This is
the specific issue between neo-Darwinism and ID.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As a critique of evolution, ID has attracted more support
than ICR and others, even among scientists, though its support among them is
still fairly small. Many Christian philosophers of science have applauded their
work.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So the question has come up as to whether ID should be
taught to school students. Developments following the Scopes trial in 1925
established the teaching of evolution in the public schools. Almost nobody
today seeks to exclude the teaching of evolution in the schools. Even Christian
creationists, on the whole, acknowledge that students should know what the
theory of evolution is, since it has become the pervasive view of biologists
and geologists. But the question now arises whether ID should be taught
alongside <span class=GramE>evolution</span> as an alternate view.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For the most part, the legal situation has not gone well for
ID. Courts have ruled that because it is “religion,” not “science,” it has no
place in a science curriculum. Further, to teach ID, many contend, is to
violate the principle of the “separation of church and state.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I hold an <span class=SpellE>originalist</span> view of the
church/state issue. The US Constitution says nothing about a “wall of
separation” between church and state. It only forbids Congress to set up a
nationally established church. When the Constitution was written, several
states had established churches. Part of the intent of the Constitution was to
give freedom to the states in this regard. Certainly none of the founders
intended to abolish all support of religion by government. Nevertheless, my
view is not the one currently sanctioned by the courts. Probably the question
of the teaching of ID will not be resolved by a rethinking of the relation of
church and state.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But more should be said on the relation of religion and
science. Is ID religion, rather than science? In my judgment, religion and
science are not easily separated, for reasons such as the following:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Science is
religious.</i> A great many writers (<span class=SpellE>Kuyper</span>, <span
class=SpellE>Dooyeweerd</span>, <span class=SpellE>Clouser</span>, Van <span
class=SpellE>Til</span>, Polanyi, Kuhn, Hanson, <span class=SpellE><span
class=GramE>Poythress</span></span>) have made an impressive case that science
is not religiously neutral. At the most obvious level, science presupposes many
things that it cannot prove, but must take on faith: the uniformity of nature,
the correspondence of thought with reality, the universality of physical laws,
the values required for the honest pursuit of truth. Indeed, their ideas and
methodology presuppose Christian theism, though not all of them are willing to
admit it.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn4' href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">
</a>[4] </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Despite the uncertainty of much science, there is also a
sense in which science, like religion, imposes “orthodoxy” on its participants.
As Kuhn indicates, bodies of research create communities of scientists, and if
anyone wants to enter that community he must not deviate from the standard
paradigms. Certainly something like this has happened among Neo-Darwinists. So
there is a strong analogy between science and religion that has been overlooked
in much of the discussion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Science is more
than observation and experiment</i>. As many of the abovementioned thinkers
point out, scientists do not simply gather data. They also propose hypotheses
for investigation. Then they must deduce consequences from those hypotheses.
Observation and experiment seek these consequences in order to verify or
falsify the hypothesis. But the hypothesis itself is not necessarily the result
of observation or experimentation. Einstein, for example, did not develop his
theories of relativity on the basis of observation or experiment. Rather, his
ideas initially came from “thought experiments,” imagining how things are
likely to be. Many of his hypotheses have subsequently been verified by
observation and experiment. Einstein was not himself an experimental scientist.
But no one would deny that he was a scientist of the first order.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The work of science, then, is not only observational and
experimental, but also imaginative and logical. The scientist must use his
imagination to determine significant hypotheses, and his logic to determine
what it would take to verify or falsify these hypotheses and whether an
experiment has, in fact, verified or falsified it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>People often complain that ID is not science, because it is
not based on observation and experiment. This charge is false, because ID
writers rely on research already done by others. And some ID writers like <span
class=SpellE>Behe</span> have done and published significant research. (Some
other ID writers have done the same, but have had trouble publishing their
findings because, they claim, of bias.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>But the main contribution of ID to the discussion is
logical: to evaluate what is required to verify evolutionary theory, to judge
whether the evidence establishes it, and if not, what changes must be made to
evolutionary theory to make it credible. ID primarily <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>interprets</i> data, rather than accumulating it. But that doesn’t make
ID unscientific.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Most neo-Darwinism today is explicitly anti-theistic.
Neo-Darwinists believe that they have established a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>naturalistic</i> basis for the origin and development of life. ID
denies that they have established this and brings up evidence to the contrary.
Why <span class=GramE>should the denial of theism</span> be considered science,
while the affirmation of it is considered “religion?” It is no less scientific
to deduce intelligent design from the data than to deduce an unintelligent
origin.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn5' href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">
[5] </a></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>So Darwinism, in some senses, is religious, and ID is
scientific.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Science must be
open to all truth</i>. Even if science and religion can be sharply
distinguished, which I deny, it is important to understand what is involved in
the “openness” of science to truth. Let’s imagine that the Bible is the
inerrant word of God, and that in that book God speaks on some matters of
importance to science. Now in the current discussion this possibility would be
dismissed as an encroachment of religion on science. But, whether Scripture is
religion or science, at least its believers claim that it is a source of truth.
If it is a source of truth, how can scientists justify ignoring or denying it?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Of course, many scientists deny that the Bible is the
inerrant word of God. But <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>if it is</i>,
those scientists are missing out on something important, just as if they
neglected important data in a study of the effect of a drug. So the question of
whether the Bible is true is a question of importance to science, as well as to
all other studies.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>ID claims that its assertions are not based on the Bible,
though most practitioners of ID are Christians. It is hard for me to imagine
that they would make the claims they do if they were not Christians. But that
issue is irrelevant. To establish the scientific character of one’s assertions,
it is not necessary to prove that they <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>don’t</i>
come from a religious authority. Since I believe the Bible is true, I think
that reliance on the Bible (properly interpreted) would be an argument in favor
of ID, rather than against it. The attempt of ID writers to distance themselves
from the Bible is, I think, an expedient to avoid certain popular objections,
rather than a position necessary to bona fide science.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I conclude that ID is just as scientific, and just as
religious, as neo-Darwinism. As such it should be given a position of parity
with Darwinism in the schools. This is not likely to happen in the near future,
because of the courts’ homage to a sharp separation between religion and
science, and because of an illegitimate doctrine of church and state. But on
the intrinsic merits of the case, the two positions should at least be taught
side-by-side.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Schools typically claim to be open to all significant points
of view. Students learn to think critically by being exposed to different
positions for evaluation. No human theory is infallible. Mistakes can be found
in the writings of neo-Darwinists and of ID writers alike. To expose children
only to the neo-Darwinist position, and to make the (to my mind fantastic)
claim that it is “fact, not theory” is to deprive them of a serious opportunity
for critical thought and to impoverish their education. That kind of dogmatism
is, to my mind, the final proof that evolutionism is religion as well as
science. Those who deny that orthodoxy, like the ID writers, are by that very
denial making a substantial contribution to science. </p>
