<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This article first appeared as an editorial in the <a
href="http://www.vnews.com/"><span style='color:windowtext'>Valley News</span></a>
on 4 September 2005.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What is <span class=GramE>science,</span> and what is
science trying to accomplish? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The goal of science is to investigate what we as humans can
empirically know but do not yet understand about the workings of nature.
Scientists do this by constructing sets of hypotheses (based on what we have
already learned) about some feature of nature that we do not understand,
testing these hypotheses by making observations and performing experiments, and
then updating our understanding based on which hypotheses are supported and
refuted by these observations and experiments. This results in a never ending cycle
of hypothesis generation, testing, and updating of our understanding.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Having been raised a Methodist and now being a member of the
<a href="http://www.ccdc-ucc.org/"><span style='color:windowtext'>Church of
Christ at Dartmouth College</span></a> in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Hanover</st1:City>,
 <st1:State w:st="on">New Hampshire</st1:State></st1:place>, I know the power
of God in people’s lives. Also, my scientific training and my career as a
practicing scientist show me that nothing in science denies the existence or
actions of God. In fact, science can only be mute on these issues, since we
cannot empirically test the existence, actions or methods of God.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Intelligent Design proposes that complexity in nature is the
identifying characteristic of the action of an Intelligent Designer: either
irreducible or specified complexity as described by Dr. Michael <span
class=SpellE>Behe</span> and Dr. William <span class=SpellE>Dembski</span>,
respectively. I interpret this to mean that the truly complex features of
nature we do not now understand should be attributed to the direct actions of
God or whomever the Intelligent Designer may have been. I have absolutely no
quarrel with the direct action of God being a valid hypothesis to explain any
feature of nature that we currently do not understand, complex or otherwise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>What makes something science is not merely having
hypotheses. Science is having hypotheses and then testing them. The Intelligent
Design hypothesis is <span class=SpellE>untestable</span> by science, exactly
because we can never empirically know or understand the actions of God or any
other Intelligent Designer. This in no way negates the validity of the
hypothesis. It simply means that this hypothesis is outside the purview of
science, because science can only support or refute hypotheses that are
empirically testable, and this is not one of them. To me, the issue is not
about any prohibition against teaching Intelligent Design, God or religion in
K-12 public schools. The issue is that the hypothesis of an Intelligent
Designer to explain features of nature should not be part of the science
curriculum, because it is outside the purview of science.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Biological evolution has been and continues to be used by
some to justify various human social agendas, what Dr. Michael Ruse, a
philosopher and historian of science, calls &quot;evolutionism&quot; in his
book The Evolution-Creation Struggle. I am as adamantly opposed to the teaching
of these social agendas as part of the science curriculum as anyone. A K-12
science curriculum should teach students the methodologies used by scientists
to explore nature and the empirically supported theories and results about how
nature works - period.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Evolution is a body of knowledge that has been and continues
to be developed, rigorously tested, and empirically supported. In fact, even
most proponents of Intelligent Design agree that evolution is important in
nature. Biological evolution results from the interplay <span class=GramE>of</span>
genetic mutations, genetic drift, gene flow and natural selection. Surely, we
have only begun to understand how these processes work and how they and other
processes have shaped the earth's biota - that's why I am a scientist and an
evolutionary biologist. All fields of science are ever expanding bases of
knowledge that are continually focused on what we do not know - remember that
the goal of science is to explore what we do not yet understand. Science's job
will be done when we know all that can be known about nature, but until then
criticisms that evolutionary biology cannot now explain any particular complex
feature of an organism are unjustified.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>And if God's hand were accepted as the scientific
explanation for some complexity of nature, scientific inquiry into that
complexity - by definition - stops. If we do this before we are sure we know
all we can about it, we may be stopping investigations on something that could
potentially be understood with more thought, insight and hard work. The various
biological causes of disease are examples of natural phenomena that were once
ascribed to the actions of God, but that through continued scientific inquiry
were found to be understandable. If science had accepted God's hand as the
explanation for disease, modern medicine would not exist. Obviously, science
will be wasting its time in its pursuit of understanding for things that truly
were the result of God's direct action, but that is the price that science must
pay, since science cannot know what is and is not understandable beforehand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Misunderstandings about evolution also come at a high price
to our economy and overall well being. For example, evolution is central to
combating infectious diseases. HIV is so pernicious because the HIV virus
evolves in the body of each infected individual. Doctors have found that the
most effective HIV treatments are those that slow or prevent this evolution. If
we did not understand evolution, these treatments would not exist. Drug
companies also invest huge sums of money to develop new antibiotics, but even
before being produced they know these drugs will be effective for only a few
years because of the evolution of resistances to them by pathogens. Specific
patient treatment strategies can slow this evolution, again because we understand
the evolutionary process. Exactly the same issues affect our agriculture
through the evolution of resistance in the pathogens and pests of our crops and
livestock. Health care and agriculture are only two of many practical areas
where a solid understanding of biological evolution is crucial. With a solid
science education that includes evolutionary biology, today's students will
find better solutions to <st1:PersonName w:st="on">tom</st1:PersonName>orrow's
problems.</p>
