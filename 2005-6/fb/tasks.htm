<p>&quot;Committee&quot; is history for Leadership since the fourth quarter of
year 1999-2000. Instead, we have &quot;Tasks&quot; now.&nbsp; There are lots of
different tasks, long-term ones and short-term ones. Examples of long-term tasks
are Lost and Found, Quad Music, and Dance Music. Examples of short-term tasks
are Super Drive, Pizza Fundraiser, CV Constitution, and volunteering projects.
New tasks are coming frequently. If you would like the input of CV Leadership
and/or would like to find out what tasks we are doing, please contact Leadership
teacher, Craig Ellingson by phone (541) 757-4531 or by email <a href="mailto:craig_ellingson@corvallis.k12.or.us">craig_ellingson@corvallis.k12.or.us</a>.&nbsp;</body>
