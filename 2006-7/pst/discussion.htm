<p><font face="Imprint MT Shadow" size="5">The motion of the lever is caused by the weight pushing down on it.&nbsp; The 
table and gravity are pushing in opposite directions, but with the same strength 
- so they balance each other out.&nbsp; The force of the weight is not balanced 
- so the lever accelerates in the direction of the force of the weight.</font></p>
<p><font face="Imprint MT Shadow" size="5">The motion of the marble is caused by gravity, friction, and the ramp.&nbsp; 
Gravity is pulling straight down on the marble.&nbsp; The surface of the ramp is 
pushing the marble at a 90 degree angle to the surface of the ramp.&nbsp; 
Friction is pushing the marble up the ramp (opposite the direction of motion).&nbsp; 
When these forces are combined, it causes an overall force down the ramp, so the 
marble accelerates down the ramp.</font></p>
