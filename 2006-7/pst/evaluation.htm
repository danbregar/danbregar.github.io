<p><font face="Imprint MT Shadow" size="5">I think I did a pretty good job on this project.&nbsp; My partner and I 
divided up the work as equally as we could.&nbsp; We worked hard in class when 
we were given time, and we came in a couple of times during lunch to finish up 
our project.&nbsp; The quality of our machine I think was very good - once we 
made all the changes and fixes at the end, it worked almost every time we ran 
it.&nbsp; We also tried to do a good job of making our parts good quality.</font></p>
<p><font face="Imprint MT Shadow" size="5">The biggest problem we ran into was that we were never able to get our 
machine to actually fold the paper into the shape of a paper airplane.&nbsp; We 
could get the sticks to hit the paper in the right place, but when the sticks 
hit the paper, it didn't fold - instead, it either wrinkled the paper or just 
knocked it off the machine.&nbsp; In order to get the paper to fold right, we 
would have needed to create some pretty elaborate stands that held the paper in 
just the right position.&nbsp; We tried to build these, but ended up running out 
of time.&nbsp; However, I think we did the best job we could in the time 
available.</font></p>
<p><font face="Imprint MT Shadow" size="5">We also tried our best to take accurate measurements of time and 
displacement.&nbsp; However, the parts often moved so quickly that we felt that 
we couldn't react fast enough to take accurate measurements.&nbsp; Also, it was 
really hard to see exactly how far the different objects moved - again, 
sometimes they moved so quickly it was too hard to see precisely where they 
stopped.&nbsp; So we just did the best we could with the equipment we had and I 
think we did a pretty good job.</font></p>
<p><font face="Imprint MT Shadow" size="5">Finally, I felt that I learned a lot about forces and motion by doing this 
project.&nbsp; Building the RGM helped me see that forces can combine, and that 
an overall force can accuse an object to accelerate.&nbsp; I also felt that I 
learned some new tricks for designing and building projects like these.&nbsp; I 
feel more comfortable using the shop tools now, and I think I got much better 
and doing quality work.</font></p>
