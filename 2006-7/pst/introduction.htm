<p><font face="Imprint MT Shadow" size="5">A Rube Goldberg Machine (RGM) is a device that is designed to accomplish a 
simple task in an extremely complicated manner.&nbsp; An examples of a Rube 
Goldberg Machine might be a device that pulls a piece of Kleenex out of a box by 
using a series of levers, pulleys, and ramps.&nbsp; There are many different 
images of Rube Goldberg Machines posted at the web site
<a href="http://www.rube-goldberg.com/">http://www.rube-goldberg.com/</a>.&nbsp; 
Here is one example from that website:</font></p>

<p><font face="Imprint MT Shadow" size="5">Rube Goldberg was an actual person who drew cartoons of Rube Goldberg 
Machines in the early 1900's.&nbsp; Now, people compete to actually build Rube 
Goldberg Machines in a contest that occurs every year.&nbsp; This year's contest 
is to take an orange, squeeze it, and pour the juice in a cup.</font></p>
<p><font face="Imprint MT Shadow" size="5">Rube Goldberg Machines are designed using simple machines - like ramps, 
levers, and pulleys - that make work easier.</font></p>
