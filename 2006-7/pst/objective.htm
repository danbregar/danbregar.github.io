<p><font face="Imprint MT Shadow" size="5"><b>Objective:</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Imprint MT Shadow" size="5">The goal of my Rube Goldberg Machine is to take a piece of paper and fold it 
into a paper airplane.&nbsp; The first step in my Rube Goldberg Machine was that 
I pressed on a lever.&nbsp; The lever caused a string to be released, which 
caused a pulley to turn because there was a weight on the other end.&nbsp; When 
the pulley turned, a stick that was attached to it pushed on a piece of paper 
that was suspended on two pieces of wood.&nbsp; The weight from the pulley fell 
on another lever, which hit a marble that was balanced at the top of a ramp.&nbsp; 
When the marble rolled down the ramp, it hit another piece of wood that was 
supposed to fold the piece of paper again (but it didn't work).&nbsp; That piece 
of wood also hit another lever, which hit another marble that was balanced on a 
ramp.&nbsp; When that marble rolled down the ramp, it hit another piece of wood 
that was supposed to make the third fold in the piece of paper (it didn't work 
either).</font></p>
