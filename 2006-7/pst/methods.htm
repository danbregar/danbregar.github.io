<p><font face="Imprint MT Shadow" size="5">To build my RGM, I needed to start by creating a series of drawings.&nbsp; 
These drawings illustrated the various ideas I had for building my machine.&nbsp; 
I came up with a bunch of different options, but settled on the design I 
described above.&nbsp; Then, I made several detailed drawings of the different 
simple machines (ramp, lever, and pulley) that were going to be in my RGM.&nbsp; 
Then, my partner and I built a &quot;mini-RGM&quot; - a quick version of an RGM - so that 
we could see what different types of problems we might need to think about.&nbsp; 
In this part of the construction, we learned some different ways to make good 
ramps, pulleys, and levers.</font></p>
<p><font face="Imprint MT Shadow" size="5">Then, we built the actual RGM.&nbsp; My partner and I split up the 
construction process.&nbsp; He build the pulley, which took the most time, and 
the ramps.&nbsp; I built the levers and started the assembly of the entire 
machine.&nbsp; When we were both done building our individual parts, we each 
helped with the final assembly.&nbsp; Once we had attached all the machines, we 
tested our RGM several times and made adjustments until it worked perfectly 
almost every time.&nbsp; (We were never able to get the second two pieces of 
wood to make folds in the piece of paper, but all the simple machines on our RGM 
moved the way they were supposed to.)&nbsp; We spent the last day of building 
trying to figure out how to make pieces of wood fold paper, but we were 
unsuccessful.</font></p>
<p><font face="Imprint MT Shadow" size="5"><b>Data Methods:</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Imprint MT Shadow" size="5">After our RGM was complete, we took some measurements and made some 
calculations about the motion of parts of our machine.&nbsp; We chose to 
measure the motion of one of the levers and one of the marbles that rolled down 
a ramp.&nbsp; To measure the displacement of the lever, we ran our RGM five 
times.&nbsp; Each time, when the second lever moved, we measured how far one end 
of the lever ended up tilting.&nbsp; We also timed how long it for the lever to 
complete its motion.&nbsp; We recorded this information in a data table.</font></p>
<p><font face="Imprint MT Shadow" size="5">The other moving object we measured was the first marble.&nbsp; We again ran 
our RGM five times, and each time measured how far the marble moved and how long 
it took to roll down the ramp (we only measured until the end of the ramp, 
although the marble sometimes fell off the end of the ramp and landed on the 
table).&nbsp; This information was also recorded in a data table.</font></p>
<p><font face="Imprint MT Shadow" size="5">For each of these objects, we calculated the velocity (displacement divided 
by time) and acceleration (velocity divided by time).&nbsp; Then we found the 
average velocity and average acceleration.</font></p>
